# Debug.Log 

If you need to print something to test what a variable says, or just to make a log statment to tell you what the code is currently doing, `Debug.log` is your man. 

`Debug.log` cannot be seen by the user, so they are only for devs. But they can be handy! Here is an example:

``` csharp
Debug.Log("Hello, World!");
```
When you run the script, you should see text saying `Hello, World!`. Since it is a string, you can put variables into the statment to see what it prints!
